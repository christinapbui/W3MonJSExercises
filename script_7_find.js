// Bonus: Return a new array, that only has inventors without a middle name. (Hint: think about splice, if you use findIndex. But you may also use another of the methods you've learned about above.)

// Find the number divisible by 7.

// Bonus: Return a new array, that only has the numbers that are not divisible by 7.
